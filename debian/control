Description: C library to store sets/maps of IP address (development files)
 The ipset library provides C data types for storing sets of IP
 addresses, and maps of IP addresses to integers.  It supports both
 IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  It's implemented using "Binary Decision
 Diagrams" (BDDs, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram),
 which (we hypothesize) makes it space efficient for large sets.
 .
 This package provides C header files for the libraries.
